# Memoize Function 🍀👩‍💻🚀
This project introduces a memoize function, a powerful utility designed to optimize function calls by caching their results. The implementation ensures that the specified function is called only once for a given set of parameters, preventing redundant computations.



## Features
The key feature of this project is the memoize function, which enhances performance by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.



## Frontend
The frontend component provides a user interface where users can input text. The application displays two sections for output: one for standard text and another for debounced text.

## Backend
The backend component handles the logic behind caching function results. It supports the functionality required for the memoize function, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of computed values.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)
The project includes a Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the memoize function and related features from the terminal, providing a seamless experience for developers.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Build the project: `npm run build`
- Run the application: `npm start`
- Run CLI: `npm run start:cli`
- Run tests: `npm test`
