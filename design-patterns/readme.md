### ****MVC****

**Model-View-Controller** is a way of organizing code that involves separating blocks that are responsible for solving different tasks. One block is responsible for the **application data**, another is responsible for the **appearance**, and the third **controls the operation** of the application.

**MVC** is the key to understanding dynamic web application development. This pattern involves separating business logic from the interface.

## MVC Components:

- **Model** - this component is responsible for the data and also determines the structure of the application. For example, if you are building a To-Do application, the `model` component code will define the task list and individual tasks.
- **View** - this component is responsible for user interaction. That is, the `view` component code defines the appearance of the application and how it can be used.
- **Controller** - this component is responsible for the connection between `model` and `view`. The `controller` component code determines how the site responds to user actions. Essentially, this is the brain of an MVC application.
