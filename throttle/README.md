# Throttle Function ‚è±Ô∏èüë©‚ÄçüíªüöÄ
This project introduces a throttle function, a powerful utility designed to control the rate at which a function is invoked. The implementation ensures that the specified function is not called more than once in a given time frame, preventing excessive execution.


## Features
Throttle Function
The primary feature of this project is the throttle function, offering control over the frequency of function execution. This proves beneficial in scenarios where you want to limit the number of times a function is called within a specific time interval.

## Frontend
The frontend component provides a user interface where users can input text. The application displays two sections for output: one for standard text and another for debounced text.

## Backend
The backend component handles the logic behind fetching and processing data. It supports the functionality required for the debounce function.

## Command Line Interface (CLI)
The project includes a Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the debounce function and related features from the terminal.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Build the project: `npm run build`
- Run the application: `npm start`
- Run CLI: `npm run start:cli`
- Run tests: `npm test`
