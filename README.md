# Sprint-2 Branch

This branch (`sprint-2`) contains three folders: `debounce`, `throttle`, and `memoize`. Each folder represents a specific functionality related to function optimization.

## Folder Structure
debounce
The debounce folder contains files related to the implementation of a debounce function. This function delays the execution of a specified function until after a specified amount of time has passed since the last invocation.

throttle
The throttle folder contains files related to the implementation of a throttle function. This utility controls the rate at which a function is invoked, ensuring it is not called more than once within a specified time frame.

memoize
The memoize folder contains files related to the implementation of a memoization function. Memoization is a technique that caches the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
