## Learn You The Node.js 📚🛠️🌍

#### Overview
Learn You The Node.js (_learnyounode_) is a workshop package for Node.js, providing a series of lessons to teach the fundamentals of writing Node.js applications. The lessons cover a range of topics, starting from basic "HELLO WORLD" exercises and progressing to more advanced concepts like synchronous/asynchronous I/O, filesystem operations, TCP and HTTP networking, events, and streams.

#### Installation
**Prerequisites**

- Node.js should be installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from Node.js official website.

**Installation Steps**

- Open a terminal and run the command:
  `npm install -g learnyounode`

> If you encounter any issues, consider prefixing the command with sudo or fixing npm permissions.

- Verify the installation by running:
  `learnyounode`
> You should see a blue screen indicating that learnyounode has been installed successfully.

### Project Setup

- Once you have downloaded the repository you should open the folder 'it-academy' and switch to the sprint-3 branch:
	`cd it-academy`
  `git checkout sprint-3`
- Then you will need to download all node modules:
  `npm install`
- And now you can run the project:
  `npm run build`
- To go to the main menu:
  `learnyounode`
- To run tests for a specific file:
  `npx jest name-of-file.test.ts`
- To run all tests:
  `npm test`

#### Getting Started

- Start learnyounode by running:
  `learnyounode`
- Use arrow keys to navigate and the enter key to select a lesson. For example, select the "HELLO WORLD" lesson.

- All the TypeScript files and tests are already done. All you need is to verify them.

#### Verify the solution with:

`learnyounode verify name-of-file.js`
Afterwards you will see a "PASS" message.

Move on to the next lesson by repeating _steps 1-4_.
